# What?

Just a collection of passwords for public wifi, mostly for bars and coffee shops and the like.

# Why?

Because I constantly find myself ordering things and forgetting to ask for the Wifi password, so then I have to go back to the counter and ask for it, which is inconvenient for everyone involved.

# I want to add something
